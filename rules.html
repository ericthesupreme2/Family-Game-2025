    <h1>Game Rules</h1>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>Welcome to the 2025 Summer Game! Each team of four will complete different challenges, earning points based on performance. However, inside one team there is a group of 3 people (4 if its the kids group because they have an extra player) secretly working against you meaning it could be your own group. Your goal is to complete the challenges while identifying which team it is and which membors.</p>

    <h2>Teams & Contestants</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Green Team (Siblings):</strong> Ben, Nick, Lex, Kate</li>
        <li><strong>Blue Team (Wives):</strong> Laura, Emma, Kerry, Anna</li>
        <li><strong>Red Team (Children):</strong> Ruben, Margot, Isaac, Eve, Isobel</li>
        <li><strong>Purple Team (Grandparents):</strong> Christopher, Hazel, Eric</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Normal Rules</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>You will play 4 different challenges.</li>
        <li>Certain challenges require finding a code so please do it legit and dont guess but to be fair i cant stop you. It would just be annoying.</li>
        <li>You will talk for a bit after each round but will only vote as to who you think it is at the end.</li>
        <li>You get 2 tries to guess the team correctly but only one try to figure out who in the team is lying and who isn't.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Sabotage Rules</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>The saboteurs know who each other are.</li>
        <li>Their goal is to make the team fail without making it obvious.</li>
        <li>Everyone will try to figure out who the saboteurs are at the end of the game.</li>
        <li>Correctly identifying saboteurs earns extra points.</li>
    </ul>
